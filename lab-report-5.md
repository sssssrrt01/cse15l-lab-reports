# Lab Report 5 - Part 1

## Step 1 
Student post: I'm not sure why my code is not working. I think the issue is because my add method is not adding the numbers together properly, but I can't figure it out. The pictures of the code and error are attached below. Thank you.

## Step 2
TA response: Hi, the testing file for this code is just a trivial test of adding two numbers. I can confirm that you are adding the numbers properly, but I would advise you to check your return value of your add method.  

## Step 3 
Student response: I see! I realize now that I am returning the wrong value. I have fixed it as such.
