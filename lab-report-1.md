Using `cd`, `ls`, and `cat` with varying arguments to observe behavior.

## Using `cd`

Using cd without any argument returns me to the home directory.

Using cd with a path as an argument will enter that directory.

Using cd on a file will bounce an error.


## Using `ls`

Using ls without arguments shows the path of the current working directory.

Using ls with a directory will show the paths of that directory.

Using ls with a file argument will bounce an error.

## Using `cat`

Using cat without arguments will take in keyboard inputs, and duplicate them.

Using cat with directories will show a message that both arguments are directories and will not do anything.

Using cat with files will concatenate the contents of the files.
